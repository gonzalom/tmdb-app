## About

The Movies Database Laravel PHP Framework App.

![Image of Listed Movies](movie-list.png)

## Description

Create a simple login system using Laravel PHP Framework.

When a user correctly logs in to the system the user should see a form with a list of movie genres.

When the user chooses a genre, movies from that genre are retrieved and displayed on the page without reloading.

The user can then select a movie to see more details about the movie, again without reloading the page.

The user should also see an input box to search for movies by name. Please display the results in the same way as the genre results.

The Genres and Movies should be returned using the API from https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api. You will need to register to gain access to the API, see the FAQ for details https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api

The purpose of this project is to determine your approach to the problem. Feel free to use any PHP and JavaScript tools you are comfortable with.

If this test cannot be completed to your satisfaction, please state how you would improve upon your method if you had the time.
